A mini project that I made  since I want to help my friends study. It took me just about three hours to make this since I did cut some corners so bear with me

This project and its inspiration are not fully mine, I based it on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtqbOFYivxw!
Credits to him for teaching me and helping me with this mini-project!
